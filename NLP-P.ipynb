Yet, as a lifelong Lutheran, I am skeptical of the many \"spiritual truths\" he issues so declaratively. He also endorses \"A Course in Miracles,\" a New Age text supposedly channeled straight from God. It's time to start asking questions about his ideas. A good place to start would be Not Necessarily the New Age: Critical Essays, edited by Robert Basil. Other books about New Age thinking can be found in libraries. Just do a subject search on \"New Age movement.\" Don't just adopt religious ideas because someone states them in a soothing, authoritative way--and various celebrities thought the book was great.
